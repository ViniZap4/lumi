# Lumi Architecture

Overview of the lumi note-taking system.

## Components

1. **TUI Client** - Terminal interface with vim motions
2. **Server** - HTTP API + WebSocket
3. **Web Client** - Svelte-based UI

## Design Principles

- Local-first: files are the source of truth
- Markdown-based: plain text, portable
- Vim-inspired: keyboard-driven navigation

## Links

See [[2026-02-16-vim-tips]] for vim commands.
